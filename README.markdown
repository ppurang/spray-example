Checkout the curl.txt for some curl interaction with the http services.


1. Launch SBT:

        $ sbt

2. Compile everything and run all tests:

        > test

    Don't worry too much if the tests fail .. :) try again! this is a known problem right now and is most probably due the way the tests are written or the version of spray used!

3. Start the application:

        > re-start

4. Service runs at http://localhost:8080/

7. Stop the application:

        > re-stop
